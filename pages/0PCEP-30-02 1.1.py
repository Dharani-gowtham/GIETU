st.markdown("""
**Interpreting:** The act of understanding and translating the meaning of something, usually from one language to another. In programming, it refers to translating human-readable code into a form the computer can directly understand and execute.

**Interpreter:** A software program that performs interpreting. It reads and executes code line by line, translating each line into machine code on the fly. Examples: Python interpreter, JavaScript interpreter.

st.subheader("Compiling vs. compiler:")
st.markdown("""

**Compiling:** The act of translating code from a high-level programming language into a lower-level language, typically machine code specific to the target computer architecture. This translation happens all at once before the program runs.

**Compiler:** A software program that performs compiling. It analyzes the entire source code and generates a standalone executable file in machine code. Examples: C++ compiler, Java compiler.
