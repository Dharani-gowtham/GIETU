             1. Basic Input: Write a program that asks the user for their name and age, then prints a greeting message including their name.\n
2. Number Input: Create a program that reads two numbers from the user and calculates their sum and average, displaying the results.
3. Formatted Output: Write a program that calculates the area of a circle and displays the result with two decimal places using string formatting.
4. User Choice: Implement a menu with options like "print hello" and "calculate area". Let the user choose the option and execute the corresponding function.
5. File Input/Output: Write a program that reads numbers from a text file and calculates their statistics (mean, median, etc.). Write the results to another file.
Variations: Explore advanced input/output methods like using command-line arguments, reading binary data, and using custom error handling.
